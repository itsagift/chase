      <p className="about-paragraph">I have been interested in technology since elementary school, when I learned to code using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. I've  been a designer and technician for theatrical productions and venues.</p>
      
      <p className="about-paragraph">I've been teaching myself for years and completed the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp in 2022. I intend to work in the intersection of art and technology-- creating software that will help artists, and working with software to create unique in-person experiences. </p> You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-reynolds-195646152/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/itsagift">Github</a>.
